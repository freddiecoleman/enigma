## Recreating the Enigma

I am moving to within 1 hour drive of Bletchley Park so thought it would be fun to build the Enigma and a bombe before going there. This is done in an object oriented way that reflects the physical machine.

Once I have done this I may progress to creating an SSH protocol using the enigma for encryption, just for fun :)
